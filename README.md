### Project Overview

The **Book Loot: Library Management System** is a simple application designed to manage the operations of a small library. It allows users to register members, add new books, borrow books, return books, reserve books, and view member profiles. The system seeks to enhance the overall experience for library workers and customers by automating library procedures.

### Features:

* **Register Members** 
* **Add New Books**
* **Borrow Books**
* **Return Books**
* **Reserve Books** 
* **View Member Profiles**

### Python Implementation

The system is implemented using Python, leveraging core programming concepts and libraries.

* **Data Structures:** The project uses lists to store book and member information. Lists are a fundamental data structure in Python, providing a flexible way to store and manage collections of data. For example, the `books` list holds all the available books, and the `members` list stores information about registered library members.
* **Functions:**  The code is organized into functions, each responsible for a specific task, such as adding a book, registering a member, or borrowing a book. Functions promote code reusability and improve readability.  For instance, the `add_book()` function handles the process of adding a new book to the library's database.
* **Control Flow:**  The project uses conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) and loops (`while`) to control the flow of execution.  This allows the program to make decisions based on user input and to repeat certain actions as needed.

### SDG 4 Integration

  This project supports **SDG 4: Quality Education** by making it easier for library members to access books and resources. By providing a convenient way to borrow and reserve books, the project aims to encourage reading and learning within the community. It specifically aligns with SDG Target 4.1, which emphasizes ensuring that all children complete quality primary and secondary education.
